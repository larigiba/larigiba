## Hi! üòÉ

I'm a computer science student at the TU Kaiserslautern in Germany, expecting to graduate in September 2023.
I interned at Amazon and Google in 2022.

## Interests

### Machine Learning

I am really passionate about Machine Learning. I did several projects before, including <a href="https://github.com/BorisGiba/neural_networks_from_scratch_python">implementing neural networks from scratch in NumPy</a>, <a href="https://github.com/BorisGiba/betterrecycling">developing a smart recycling system on a Raspberry Pi using CNNs in PyTorch</a>, <a href="https://borisgiba.com/chatbot/">developing a simple chatbot and deploying it to the web using Tensorflow.js</a>, and many more!
In high school, I have won several highly prestigious awards through my work in the field of machine learning. In addition, I worked as a research assistant at my local Fraunhofer institute for 2.5 years in high school and at the start of my degree.

### Teaching

I am extremely passionate about teaching and making education in tech more accessible for everyone. This is why, in 2020, I started volunteering for the German National Competition in AI and I started creating online courses about ML topics. My courses were the foundation for the competition's free online learning platform. I have worked on an additional course about Python and one about the basics of machine learning. I started organizing an annual machine learning hackathon for the competition, writing short articles about useful ML tips and tricks, and more!
I am so passionate about teaching machine learning that I even <a href="https://machinelearningcompass.com">made my own blog about ML</a>! It even has its own emoji-domain:

### Cloud and Infrastructure Engineering

While working on machine learning is a lot of fun, I found that I didn't learn enough about planning, building, deploying and maintaining large (machine learning and just general software) systems.
I became very interested in learning more about how large tech companies run services with billions of users and virtually no downtime, all across the world.
This lead me to my internships in 2022. I interned as a Software Development Engineer at AWS in Dublin, where I worked on the CloudWatch infrastructure team. Afterwards, I also took a trip to Google in London where I interned as a Site Reliability Engineer on the Google Cloud Compute Engine team.
Throughout these internships, not only did I learn a lot about professional software development, but I also learned how to work on infrastructure systems for the most high-traffic software projects in the world.

### Frontend Development and Visualizations

I absolutely _love_ designing beautiful, interactive, and fun interfaces. I was frustrated with the current form of machine learning education online, and I wanted to present the information in my own unique way, so I did what every person with minimal web development experience would do: Start a blog using React, TypeScript, Gatsby and GraphQL. I implemented several unique features such as customizeable, interactive 2D- and 3D-visualizations and animations using Plotly.js. I also developed a client-side fully executable Python code editor with support for writing code in multiple files, plotting visualizations, running unit tests, and more, using Pyodide (this was before PyScript was announced!). I also added multiple-choice questions and programming exercises to some of my blog posts and I had some other crazy ideas (f.e. visualizing and clustering the blog articles as an interactive graph) which I unfortunately didn't get to finish yet.
